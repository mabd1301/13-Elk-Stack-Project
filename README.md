### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures the web application is available across multiple web application servers restricting unwanted or unecessary access to the Network.

 A Load Balancers also may mitigate some DoS attacks as it can balance the load across many web application servers. Typically without the clients having to understand how many servers are in use or how they are configured.load balancers include a health probe to check all of the servers in its pool are functioning appropriately before sending traffic to them or it will stop sending traffic to missing or poor performing servers providing better uptime for the web application.

A Jump Box is similar to a gateway router as it becomes a single point of a protected network exposed to the public network as it sits in front of the other machines that are not exposed to the Internet. futher explanation is that the jump box is a secure computer that all admins first connect to before launching any administrative task or use as an origination point to connect to other servers or untrusted environments.
To further control access only specified IP addresses and port 22 are allowed access to the Jump Box. To avoid the username and password weakness of SSH we used asynchronous encryption keys to ensure a higher degree of protection than usernames and passwords.

Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the machine metrics and system logs.

Filebeat is used to capture system logs or file locations you specify then sending data to the ELK Server for indexing and review.

Metricbeat is used to capture machine metrics on Linux, Windows, and Mac hosts then forwarding to the ELK Server to track system level CPU usage, memory, file system, disk I/O, and network I/O metricbeat

The configuration details of each machine may be found below.

### Access Policies

- The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet. 

- Only the Jump box machine can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresses:

- Machines within the network can only be accessed by Jump Box with the private IP address 10.0.0.4

A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.

### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because...
its simplifys deployment from the central location that can be used to expand or redeploy the ELK Stack just by running an Ansible playbooks.

The playbook implements the following tasks:
In 3-5 bullets, explain the steps of the ELK installation play. E.g., install Docker; download image; etc._

- The playbook implements the following tasks:
- First I Install docker.io, Python, and the Docker Module.
- Then I Configure the ELK Server memory and increased.
- After that I Download Docker ELK Container and configure it.



### Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:

- **10.0.0.5**
- **10.0.0.6**
- **10.0.0.7**

I have installed the following Beats on these machines:

- **Filebeat**
- **Metricbeat**

These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:

- System log and application log details which include Web Traffic is gathered by Filebeat.
- CPU, Memory, Disk, Network, and other top-like statics are gathered with Metricbeat.

### Using the Playbook

In order to use the playbook, I will need to have an Ansible control node already configured, Ansible control node on the jump box  

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:

- Copy the configuration file to the /etc/ansible/files/ to make configuration changes.
- Update the /etc/ansible/hosts file to include the targeted machine or machines.
- Create the <role>-playbook.yml file with the required tasks to be run by ansible-playbook.
- Run the playbook then navigate to the ELK Server Kibana data installation page to check the Module status that the installation worked as expected.

Ansible playbook files were <role>-playbook.yml files located on the Jump Server within the Ansible Docker container in the /etc/ansible/roles/ folder.

In order update specific machines we edited the /etc/ansible/hosts by ensuring the [header] element is not commented out with a # or needs to be created then the hostname/IP of the machines are added to the file for Ansible to target groups of machines.

- Navigating to <http://104.210.155.66/app/kibana> successfully ensures the ELK Server is running and is ready for use.

## Commands I used to install  ELK Stack, Filebeat, and Metricbeat

- first I Install the ELK Stack on the elk server.
- then Connected to the Jump Box and attach to the Ansible container
- SSH into the Jump-Box by using ssh RedAdmin@104.211.14.49

- Locate the container name:

```bash
Azureuser@Jump-Box-Provisioner:~$ sudo docker container list -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                          COMMAND                  CREATED       STATUS                   PORTS     NAMES
 56b633ca508c  cyberxsecurity/ansible         "/bin/sh -c /bin/bas…"   3 weeks ago   Exited (0) 2 hours ago              intelligent_joliot
```

- Start the container:

```bash
- Azureuser@Jump-Box-Provisioner:~$ sudo docker container start  intelligent_joliot
```

```bash
- root@54c365na980c:~#
```

- Attach (connect) to the Ansible container:  intelligent_joliot

```bash
- Azureuser@Jump-Box-Provisioner:~$ sudo docker container attach  intelligent_joliot
```

```bash
- root@54c365na980c:~#
```

### Update the Ansible hosts file and create yml playbook file

Add the ELK Server IP address to the Ansible /etc/ansible/hosts file creating an [elk] section with the IP address:

- Open hosts file:

```bash
root@54c365na980c:~# nano /etc/ansible/hosts
```

Add the [elk] section followed by the ELK Server IP address:

[elk]

10.1.0.4

Create the Ansible playbook used to install and configure elk container on  ELK Server virtual machine.

```bash
- root@54c365na980c:~# nano /etc/ansible/roles/elk-playbook.yml
```

ELK install and the configuration tasks can be seen in the elk-playbook.yml playbook to automate ELK Stack deployment.

Exit nano and save the playbook.

### Running the Playbook and testing the results

- Run the Ansible playbook:

```bash
root@54c365na980c::/etc/ansible/roles# ansible-playbook elk-playbook.yml
```

```bash
root@54c365na980c:/etc/ansible/roles# ansible-playbook elk-playbook.yml

- the ELK server container is up and running.

**Navigate to http://52.175.211.238:5601/app/kibana to verify the ELK Stack is running**
**Use the public IP address of the ELK server from Azure.**

### Install the Filebeat on to the webserver virtual machines

First i Create the Filebeat Configuration File
Stay attached to the Ansible container on the Jump box.
then Install the ELK Stack on the elk server after that i  Connected to the Jump Box and attach to the Ansible container for steps to attach to the Ansible container.
then Copy filebeat-config.yml to the Ansible container.

```bash
root@54c365na980c:/etc/ansible# curl https://gist.githubusercontent.com/slape/5cc350109583af6cbe577bbcc0710c93/raw/eca603b72586fbe148c11f9c87bf96a63cb25760/Filebeat > /etc/ansible/files/filebeat-config.yml

```

I Edit the Filebeat configuration file to send Beat traffic to the ELK Stack container running on the ELK Server.

```bash
root@54c365na980c:/etc/ansible# nano -l /etc/ansible/files/filebeat-config.yml
```

- In order To send data to the ELK Server I hvae to add IP addressto the filebeat-config.yml.
Scroll to line #1105 and set the IP address of the ELK server leaving the port :9200 in place.
Note that the default credentials are elastic:changeme and should be changed to the proper username and password

- I should look like something like this

output.elasticsearch:
hosts: ["10.1.0.4:9200"]
username: "elastic"
password: "changeme"

After that I Scroll to line #1805 to replace the IP address with the ELK Server's IP Address and leaving the port :5601 in place.

- it should look like something like this

setup.kibana:
host: "10.1.0.4:5601"

<details><summary> Filebeat Installation Playbook file</summary>
<br> 

- Download the .deb file from artifacts.elastic.co.
- Install the .deb file using the dpkg command shown below:
- dpkg -i filebeat-7.6.1-amd64.deb
- Copy the Filebeat configuration file from the Ansible container to webservers.
- Used the Ansible module copy to copy the entire configuration file into the correct place.
- Run the filebeat modules enable system command.
- Run the filebeat setup command.
- Run the service filebeat start command.
- Enable the Filebeat service on boot.

Then I Build the playbook from the task overview using nano, Ansible, and Eleastic documentation.

```bash
root@54c365na980c::~# nano /etc/ansible/roles/filebeat-playbook.yml
```

Filebeat install and configuration tasks will be  in the filebeat-playbook.yml playbook to automate the deployment of Filebeat.

### Further Steps

While this architure is secure enough, 
we can and should further harden setups by fallowing this steps:

- limiting the number of machines that our jump box can access.
- locking the root account and limiting sudo access of the admin acount on the jump box
- implementing long monitoring on the jump box.
- implementing two-factor authentication for SSH loging to the jump box.
- implementing a host firewall (UFC OR IPtables) on the jump box.
- limiting jump box network access with a virtual private network (VPN).

Thank you so much for reading my ELK-Stack project, and I hope this further shows my skillset.
